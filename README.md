# Decision-Tree (Non-parametric Classifiers)
"Breast cancer" data classifier using Decision Tree

Use the following dataset for this question: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+
Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29. 
use the first 70 percent examples for training, next 10 percent examples for validation, and last 20 percent examples for testing.


1. Implement ID3 algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm

2. Implement the decision tree pruning algorithm discussed in the class (via validation data).
